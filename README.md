Personal Portfolio Website. Here I am considering of using three js to create my website. So any contributions are welcome.

I am also learning nvim, git and also javascript so there will be many unnecessary commits not releated to the projects like "Hello Cube" from Three js to it.

Thank You for your persistance.
